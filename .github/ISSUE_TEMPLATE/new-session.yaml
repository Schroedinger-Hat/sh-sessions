        # Sponsors

        The Schrödinger Session must be self-financed by seeking sponsors who can finance:

        - The costs for renting equipment (microphones, projectors, etc.).
        - Any costs for buffet and gadgets.
        
        Companies that finance the event will have the following benefits:
        
        - Acknowledgments during the event.
        - Logo on the digital poster of the event.
        - Pre-event citation on Schrödinger Hat's communication channels.
